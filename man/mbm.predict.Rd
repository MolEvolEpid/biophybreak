\arguments{
\item{BED}{A vector of BED values, one for each individual. Can be omitted.}

\item{LAg}{A vector of LAg values, one for each individual. Can be omitted.}

\item{CD4}{A vector of CD4 values, one for each individual. These are the actual CD4+ T-cell concentrations, not the square-root transformed ones used in previous versions. 
Can be omitted.}

\item{pol}{A vector for the proportion of polymorphic sites in the HIV polymerase gene, one for each individual.
This value must be provided.}

\item{pol2}{A vector of values for the diversity in the HIV polymerase gene as obtained from NGS, one for each individual. Can be omitted.}

\item{prev.neg.time}{The amount of time in between an individual's positive HIV test and a previous negative test. 
Use Inf or NA if no previous negative test is available.}

\item{t.BED.delay}{A vector or matrix for the difference in time (in years (days/365.25)) between the dates of the positive test and when BED was sampled.}

\item{t.LAg.delay}{A vector or matrix for the difference in time (in years (days/365.25)) between the dates of the positive test and when LAg was sampled.}

\item{t.CD4.delay}{A vector or matrix for the difference in time (in years (days/365.25)) between the dates of the positive test and when CD4 was sampled.}

\item{t.pol.delay}{A vector or matrix for the difference in time (in years (days/365.25)) between the dates of the positive test and when pol was sampled.}

\item{t.pol2.delay}{A vector or matrix for the difference in time (in years (days/365.25)) between the dates of the positive test and when pol2 was sampled.}

\item{mub}{A vector of length 12 for the means of the random effects parameters for the Multiple Biomarker Model.}

\item{Sigmab}{A 12x12 matrix for the covariance matrix of the random effects parameters for the Multiple Biomarker Model}

\item{sigmae}{A vector for the variances (not standard deviations) of the error paramemeters in the Multiple Biomarker Model}

\item{n.adapt}{The number of iterations to adapt the rjags MCMC model}

\item{n.burn}{The number of iterations of burn-in for the rjags MCMC model}

\item{n.iter}{The number of iterations of samples for the rjags MCMC model.}

\item{inf.mean}{The mean of the gamma distribution used for the prior distribution when there is no previous negative test. Default value is 2 years.}

\item{inf.sd}{The mean of the gamma distribution used for the prior distribution when there is no previous negative test. Default value is 1.5 years.}

\item{max.seroconvert.delay}{The maximum reasonable about of time that someone can be infected before an HIV test would be positive.}

\item{output.raw}{If TRUE, the output will include all MCMC samples for the infection ages.}

\item{seed}{The RNG seed to use.}
}
\value{
The probability density of the infection times for each patient. 
  "pdf" is a continous function and "pdf.num" is a density class object as produced by the density function.
  If output.raw is TRUE, "raw" is the matrix of MCMC samples of the infection ages for all individuals.
